      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working remotely. This is one of those subjects on which there is a thousand different opinions. And seeing I am planning to make a life as a digital nomad, I have thought quite a bit about this subject myself. In the past I have interviewed people and put together teams. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a strong advocate of having an on-site location. The past year I have realized and seen that it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to assume it&amp;rsquo;s always the best way or that having remote working developers doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting! Finally I am ready to take the next step. I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted out the things I needed and started a business that allows me to begin my freelance work. The time has come to find my first assignment and with that, start my first adventure as digital nomad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am almost 4,5 months into my journey and already flying back to the Netherlands. A lot has happened and I have made a couple of realizations that have made me (temporarily) come back sooner than planned.&lt;/p&gt;

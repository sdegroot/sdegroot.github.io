      <description>I was asked to give a talk on Event Driven Architectures at Landelijk Architectuur Congres. This Dutch conference was hosted in &amp;rsquo;s Hertogenbosch on November 17th-18th 2016.
The talk explains in more detail on how Twyp&amp;rsquo;s architecture is based on the reactive manifesto. During this presentation I am explaining how Twyp is architected and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in over two years of development.
Unfortunately the talk was not recorded. But you can find the slides on SlideShare.</description>

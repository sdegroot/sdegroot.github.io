      <title>Silence can be deafening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s 6 PM, it’s pitch dark outside and I’m all alone in my campervan. I have parked in a free camping spot near a swamp about 150km land inward. There’s nobody here except me and a some animals. I can’t see them but I know they’re there. I can tell, because, every once in a while some animal makes a screeching noise outside. However, most of the time, I hear nothing, nothing at all; complete silence. It’s somewhat disturbing really.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At last, I have arrived in the country I really wanted to go to: New Zealand. Without a plan or even the slightest idea on how to travel through New Zealand, I took the plane from the metropool Singapore to the country of backpackers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 5, 2018, my journey finally started. The first stop you ask? Singapore! Spending a little over 6 days in this &lt;em&gt;city-state&lt;/em&gt;, allowed me to see quite a bit of what this city has to offer. My verdict? Must visit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to see more? Follow me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polarsteps.com/luminosity/503421-backpacking-oceania-and-south-east-asia&#34;&gt;Polarsteps&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a really cool app, definitely worth taking a look if you are travelling yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to make a decision in your life that goes against everything you ever learned. Recently I made such a decision by quitting my job and buying a ticket to the other side of the world.
And now the adventure begins&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally it happened. On 30 januari 2018 I have organized &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Netherlands-Camunda-User-Group/events/245891545/&#34;&gt;my first meetup&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Netherlands-Camunda-User-Group/&#34;&gt;Netherlands Camunda User Group&lt;/a&gt;. What an experience was this. So much has happened to make this event come to life and using this blog post I want to share my experiences in the hopes to inspire others!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reviving and repurposing this blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since my last post. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write an active blog but I somehow never find the time or the energy to start writing. It&amp;rsquo;s really a shame because writing usually really helps me with digesting my thoughts. Wether this is on a personal or on a professional level, writing helps me to think clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logging without compromising on detail or performance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Application logging. Have you ever had to choose between detailled logging or performance?
Where you on one side wanted to log something on a certain level of detail while
you knew that this would have an enormous impact on the performance of your application?
This is exactly the situation I was in while working on some high-load services at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twyp.com/&#34;&gt;Twyp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Talk: TWYP - An event driven architecture in a fast growing ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://lovetoautomate.it/2016/12/talk-twyp---an-event-driven-architecture-in-a-fast-growing-ecosystem/</link>

      <guid>https://lovetoautomate.it/2016/12/talk-twyp---an-event-driven-architecture-in-a-fast-growing-ecosystem/</guid>
      <description>I was asked to give a talk on Event Driven Architectures at Landelijk Architectuur Congres. This Dutch conference was hosted in &amp;rsquo;s Hertogenbosch on November 17th-18th 2016.
The talk explains in more detail on how Twyp&amp;rsquo;s architecture is based on the reactive manifesto. During this presentation I am explaining how Twyp is architected and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in over two years of development.
Unfortunately the talk was not recorded. But you can find the slides on SlideShare.</description>

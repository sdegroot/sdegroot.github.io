      <description>&lt;p&gt;Application logging. Have you ever had to choose between detailled logging or performance?
Where you on one side wanted to log something on a certain level of detail while
you knew that this would have an enormous impact on the performance of your application?
This is exactly the situation I was in while working on some high-load services at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twyp.com/&#34;&gt;Twyp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was asked to give a talk on Event Driven Architectures at Landelijk Architectuur Congres. This Dutch conference was hosted in &amp;rsquo;s Hertogenbosch on November 17th-18th 2016.
The talk explains in more detail on how Twyp&amp;rsquo;s architecture is based on the reactive manifesto. During this presentation I am explaining how Twyp is architected and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in over two years of development.
Unfortunately the talk was not recorded. But you can find the slides on SlideShare.</description>

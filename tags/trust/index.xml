      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working remotely. This is one of those subjects on which there is a thousand different opinions. And seeing I am planning to make a life as a digital nomad, I have thought quite a bit about this subject myself. In the past I have interviewed people and put together teams. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a strong advocate of having an on-site location. The past year I have realized and seen that it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to assume it&amp;rsquo;s always the best way or that having remote working developers doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

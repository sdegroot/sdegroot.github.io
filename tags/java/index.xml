      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting! Finally I am ready to take the next step. I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted out the things I needed and started a business that allows me to begin my freelance work. The time has come to find my first assignment and with that, start my first adventure as digital nomad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Application logging. Have you ever had to choose between detailled logging or performance?
Where you on one side wanted to log something on a certain level of detail while
you knew that this would have an enormous impact on the performance of your application?
This is exactly the situation I was in while working on some high-load services at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twyp.com/&#34;&gt;Twyp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

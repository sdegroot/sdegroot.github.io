              <p>At last, I have arrived in the country I really wanted to go to: New Zealand. Without a plan or even the slightest idea on how to travel through New Zealand, I took the plane from the metropool Singapore to the country of backpackers!</p>

<h2 id="not-the-best-start">Not the best start</h2>

<p>Leaving Singapore was not as easy as I would&rsquo;ve thought when I arrived there. The city had so much to offer, and well, the weather was just so great after the cold winter days in the Netherlands. Just imagine my face when I arrived in Christchurch, after a 12 hour flight and realizing: crap, it&rsquo;s a gloomy day with the gauge barely reaching 14 degrees celcius. I can&rsquo;t deny the thought &ldquo;What have I done&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t cross my mind. It didn&rsquo;t completely come as a surprise, as I did do my research, but it was a painful confirmation nonetheless.</p>

<p>I prebooked the <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Urbanz-Christchurch/Christchurch/274618">Urbanz hostel</a> for three nights a couple of weeks before.  Normally, I prefer to find hostels when I arrive, but after long flights I usually just want to drop my bag and sleep for a few hours. The Urbanz hostel is a good hostel if you are looking for clean beds, good facilities and fair prices. However, if you are looking for a hostel with atmosphere, it is definitely not the place to be. Not sure what was going on when I was booking the hostel, but I don&rsquo;t think it was my best pick so far. I only realized when I arrived that this hostel has hundres of beds. It&rsquo;s one of those big ones, where you are just one of many and nobody talks to each other.</p>

<p>Well, so far this blog post hasn&rsquo;t been very positive, has it? Unfortunately after spending a day in Christchurch, I realized that this city isn&rsquo;t particularly interesting for travellers. It is still recovering from the massive earthquake in 2011. There&rsquo;s loads of roadworks and in general the city doesn&rsquo;t feel anything more than just one big suburban area. I guess this is why most travellers start in Auckland, not Christchurch. On top of all this, it seems everyone I meet, wants to get out of Christchurch as fast as possible. Well, this doesn&rsquo;t leave much room for positivity, now does it? Haha! (yes, I was able to see the humour in the situation)</p>

<h2 id="figuring-out-how-to-leave-christchurch">Figuring out how to leave Christchurch</h2>

<p>Not letting any of this let me down, I decided to really do my best to talk up to people in the hostel. And even though most were not interested in a longer conversation than five minutes, I managed to find out quite a bit about how I should continue my journey. There&rsquo;s roughly four ways you can travel: by intercity bus, an organized bus tour, hitchhiking and buying/renting a car. Every option has several pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s, and honestly, I had a really hard time choosing which way to go.</p>

<p>After some research I decided that the organized bus tour wasn&rsquo;t an option for me. I like my freedom and these bus tours (depending on which one you choose), can feel more like a school trip rather than travelling. And besides, the age range taking for example the Kiwi experience is quite a bit younger than I am. This was just not going to work. Stray was supposed to be better suited, but honestly I don&rsquo;t want to commit to something like this. Especially because they choose the hostels (and probably charge you too much).</p>

<p><img src="https://lovetoautomate.it/images/travelling/new-zealand/christchurch-on-our-way.jpg" alt="On our way, in the car" /></p>

<p>That leaves me with the three remaining options. In the hostel I met a really nice French girl, that told me she had been hitchhiking through New Zealand for quite some weeks already. Apparently hitchhiking is something completely normal here. Hitchhikers usually have to wait 2 min to max. 1 hour to get picked up. This is quite amazing, and I would love to try this out. But at the same time, the inner Dutch voice said something like: dude, what if you are not picked up? Or you can&rsquo;t reach your final destination somehow? It&rsquo;s so strange, I have met 18 year old girls hitchhiking everywhere and here I am, 26 years old, and afraid of taking a risk. Well, even though in the end, I didn&rsquo;t choose to start hitchhiking through New Zealand, I am feeling the urge to take the plunge and just try it a couple of times.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the end I didn&rsquo;t really have to make the decision. Via-via I learned that there was another Dutch guy was staying in the same hostel and he&rsquo;d already bought a car! This seemed perfect, so I went on a man-hunt for a Dutch guy that just recently bought a car. Did I mention that I was staying in a hostel with several hunderds of beds? Haha.</p>

<p>It took me almost half a day of asking random guys if they are &ldquo;the Dutch guy that recently bought a car&rdquo;, and when I was about to get some lunch, I decided to give it one more shot on my way out. Somehow, I think it was meant to be. Not only did I finally find the guy that I was looking for, both of us planned exactly six weeks in New Zealand! The thing that really convinced me that this was meant to be, was the fact that Cas is in IT, just like me&hellip; What are the chances?</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>As Cas already formed an idea on how he wanted to travel through New Zealand, I just went with it. I mean, after all, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what route you take. It&rsquo;s actually quite nice to not be the one that researches and plans everything. Not that I am not doing any research of course, but Cas definitely takes care of this for the biggest part.
<br /><br /></p>

    <span class="caption">Shelby - our ride!</span>
  
</div>


<p>The plan is to spend about four weeks in the South Island and two weeks in the North Island. We based this decision on the input of others telling us that the South Island has better nature. And frankly, with my experience in Christchurch, I am tempted to believe that New Zealand doesn&rsquo;t offer much of a city experience in general. Maybe this will be better in Wellington or Auckland, let&rsquo;s see!</p>

<p>Cas bought a sweet ride that we named Shelby, named after the character from Peaky Blinders. Why you ask? Well, in the series, Shelby smokes and drinks a lot. Just like this car&hellip; We checked out the car thoroughly but just to be sure, we are now Premium members of the NZ Automobile Association ;-).</p>

<h2 id="following-my-progress">Following my progress</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to start my journey through New Zealand! I will keep writing about my experiences. I expect to write a new blog post about every month, but no promises&hellip;</p>

<p>What is important though, is, as I mentioned in a previous blog post, that I will be using Polarsteps to track my journey. This app records the route I have taken and allows to add <code>steps</code> at certain geographical locations. I have found it to be a very useful app to share my journey with others. Since I arrived in Christchurch, I have been keeping it up to date. So check out my <a href="https://www.polarsteps.com/luminosity/503421-backpacking-oceania-and-south-east-asia">Polarsteps trip</a> to see my trip in more detail!</p>

I&rsquo;ve always been a strong advocate of having an on-site location. The past year I have realized and seen that it&rsquo;s a mistake to assume it&rsquo;s always the best way or that having remote working developers doesn&rsquo;t work.</p></div>
